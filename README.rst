Warning, this is not an introduction to Python. Rather it is a notebook
containing curated examples for Python 3 as well as the new features found in
Python 3.6. It is designed to accompany technical corporate training offered by
the author or aid those who want a quick refresher to the Python syntax.

Thanks
